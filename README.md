# Pathos
Rediscover your "why" as a maker. Pathos is an ever expanding digital and analogous toolkit that guides neurodivergent founders and creators build their own productivity and mental health solutions.

Designed by creator-maker duo, <a href="https://twitter.com/ismimao>@ismimao</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/theonikomao">@theonikolai</a>, both digital and physical forms of the journal are completely customizable with delicately designed to provide both the structure and flexibility sorely missed from traditional products and methods.

## Why is it open source?

Well, we recognize that everyone has different ideals for the *"perfect world,"* and we want **you** to have the chance to build it alongside us to ensure a cohesive experience.
